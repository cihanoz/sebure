# Task 3.4: Basic Sharding Implementation

## Files Modified
- core/src/blockchain/sharding.rs

## Implementation Details

### Shard Synchronization Mechanism
- Added state synchronization between shards
- Implemented block header sharing
- Added consensus state verification
- Implemented neighbor shard communication
- Added state root verification

### Shard State Verification
- Implemented Merkle root verification
- Added cross-shard consistency checks
- Implemented shared account verification
- Added cross-shard transaction verification
- Implemented validator signature verification

## Testing Results
- Basic shard assignment tests passing
- Cross-shard message passing tests passing
- State synchronization tests pending
- State verification tests pending

## Notes
- Shard synchronization is implemented asynchronously
- State verification includes both local and cross-shard checks
- Validator signatures are verified for each shard state
- Cross-shard communication uses the existing network layer

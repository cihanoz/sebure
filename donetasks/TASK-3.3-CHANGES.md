## Overview
Implemented hierarchical node organization system with:
- Supernode functionality
- Node role assignment
- Tiered routing
- Reputation management

## Affected Files
1. `core/src/network/supernode.rs`
2. `core/src/consensus/role_assignment.rs` 
3. `core/src/network/routing.rs`
4. `core/src/network/reputation.rs`
5. `core/src/types/node.rs`

## Implementation Details

### Supernode Functionality

## Development Workflow

Each task should follow this workflow:
1. **Requirements Refinement**: Define detailed requirements based on the PRD
2. **Design**: Create technical design and architecture documents
3. **Implementation**: Develop the feature with appropriate tests
4. **Testing**: Perform unit, integration, and system testing
5. **Documentation**: Update technical and user documentation
6. **Review**: Conduct code and design reviews
7. **Deployment**: Integrate with the main codebase

## Task Dependencies

Tasks within each milestone generally depend on previous tasks in that milestone. Additionally, each milestone builds upon the previous milestone's completion. Some specific cross-milestone dependencies include:

- Task 2.2 (Background Validation) depends on Task 1.5 (Consensus Mechanism)
- Task 3.4 (Basic Sharding) is a prerequisite for Task 4.1 (Dynamic Sharding)
- Task 4.5 (Smart Contract Foundation) is required for Task 5.3 (Interoperability)
- Task 4.7 (Trust-Optional Architecture) enables Task 5.6 (Identity-Centric Features)

## Priority Levels

Tasks are generally expected to be completed in the order presented, but some tasks have higher priority:

- **Critical Path**: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.2, 2.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2
- **High Priority**: 1.6, 2.1, 2.6, 3.1, 3.5, 4.4, 5.4, 5.8
- **Medium Priority**: All other tasks

## Estimated Effort

- **Milestone 1**: ~4 months
- **Milestone 2**: ~3 months
- **Milestone 3**: ~3 months
- **Milestone 4**: ~3 months
- **Milestone 5**: ~4 months

These timelines align with the phased approach outlined in the PRD section 6.

# SEBURE Blockchain

SEBURE is a next-generation blockchain platform designed with adaptive scaling, environmental efficiency, and user-centric design. It aims to deliver a blockchain solution that is both powerful for desktop validators and simple for mobile wallet users.

## Project Overview

SEBURE is designed as a dual-interface blockchain platform:
- Desktop applications (Mac and Linux) serving as full validation nodes
- Mobile applications (iOS and Android) functioning as lightweight wallet clients

The platform introduces innovative architectural features while maintaining simplicity and usability for end users.

## Key Features

- High-performance, Rust-based blockchain core
- Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism
- Multi-layered architecture with parallel processing
- Sharded state database for scalability
- Environmental efficiency through optimized validation
- User-friendly interfaces for both node operators and wallet users

## Repository Structure

- `/core` - Core blockchain components written in Rust
- `/cli` - Command-line interface for blockchain interaction
- `/ffi` - Foreign Function Interface (FFI) bindings for integration with other languages
- `/docs` - Documentation resources
- `/ui` - User interface components built with Flutter for desktop and mobile
- `/.github` - GitHub workflows for CI/CD automation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.68.0 or later
- Cargo package manager
- Git

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sebure/sebure-blockchain.git
   cd sebure-blockchain
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the CLI:
   ```
   cargo run --bin sebure
   ```

### CLI Commands

- Initialize a new blockchain:
  ```
  sebure init --network-id sebure-dev --shard-count 4
  ```

- Start a node:
  ```
  sebure start --listen-addr 127.0.0.1:8765
  ```

- Create a new account:
  ```
  sebure create-account
  ```

- Show account information:
  ```
  sebure show-account <address>
  ```

- Send a transaction:
  ```
  sebure send-transaction --from <sender> --to <recipient> --amount <amount>
  ```

## Development Status

SEBURE Blockchain is currently in early development. The core components and architecture are being established.
